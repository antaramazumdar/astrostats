    "1. From the class data, can you to determine if the M&M manufacturers make equal numbers of yellow, red, and green of M&Ms? Is there evidence for equal numbers of M&Ms? Is there evidence that one color may be added at a higher rate than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - Based on the data, it seems that the M&M manufacturers make more of the green M&Ms and about equal numbers of red and yellow M&Ms. Red and Yellow are less than 1 standard deviation of each other, this means that they are more than 68% close. Green, on the other hand, lies entirely outside of the standard deviations of both other colors. This suggests that green may be added at a higher rate than others."
